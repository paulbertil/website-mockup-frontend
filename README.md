# Mockshow - Create a high quality mockup of your website or web app
To showcase my projects, i previously used an app called screenpeek. One day, the app went offline and i went to search for competitors that i could use and found none that does not require manual work.


This got me thinking about how i could create a similar app myself and started to plan out what i would need to make it happen.


## Task

Create an app that makes the process of creating mockups from websites and web apps fast, easy and looks professional by using high quality images and up to date and well designed mockup devices.

## Challange

The app should not require any manual work other than entering a URL and choose preferred mockup device.

## Concept

Mockshow can go to any URL, take a high quality screenshot of the page and then creating a mockup with a well designed device illustration showcasing the website or web app, within seconds.
